Proposals are now invited for long presentations (20 minutes), short presentations (7 minutes), and project showcases (10 minutes) in all areas of digital humanities. Presentations may take the form of interactive presentations, short papers, project demos, workshops, or panel discussions. We welcome proposals from emerging and veteran students, teachers, and scholars. 

We encourage submissions on all aspects of using and/or studying digital computation within the interpretive context of the humanities, but especially on the role of communities of collaboration and faceted teamwork within this domain.

The proposal deadline is **February 1, 2016**. Proposers will be notified by **March 1, 2016**.

Please submit your name, email address, title of your proposed presentation/demo/showcase/workshop and a proposal of 200-300 words in the form below.

We will be offering a number of student bursaries in support of presenting a paper or a showcase at the conference.
