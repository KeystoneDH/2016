The Keystone Digital Humanities conference will be held at the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from **June 22-24, 2016.**

We invite proposals for long presentations (20 minutes), short presentations (7 minutes), and project showcases (10 minutes) in all areas of the digital humanities. We also invite submissions for a limited number of opportunities for interactive presentations, workshops, and/or panel discussions (60 to 90 minutes). Proposals are welcome from emerging and veteran students, teachers, and scholars.

We encourage submissions on all aspects of using and/or studying digital computation within the interpretive context of the humanities, but especially on the role of **communities of collaboration** and faceted teamwork across disciplines within this area of scholarly inquiry.

The EXTENDED proposal deadline is **February 8, 2016**. Proposers will be notified by **March 1, 2016**.

Please submit your name, email address, title of your proposed presentation (or showcase/workshop/panel) and a proposal of 200-300 words in the form below.

We will be offering a number of student bursaries in support of presenting a paper or a showcase at the conference. This will include a conference fee waiver and some funds to partially cover travel and living expenses. Note that only students who are submitting a presentation/demo/showcase/workshop proposal will be considered. [Click here to apply for this financial assistance]( http://goo.gl/forms/g1uDbbrKOS).
