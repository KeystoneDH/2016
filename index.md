KeystoneDH is committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in the Digital Humanities among Pennsylvania-based institutions of Higher Education. Our goal is to encourage community and collaboration among Pennsylvania-based institutions of higher education engaged in Digital Humanities Research or Pedagogy. We invite schools and constituents within schools to participate across traditional “peer institution” or categorical divide, as well as across faculty, staff, and students (undergraduate and graduate) as well as independent scholars.
